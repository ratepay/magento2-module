IMPORTANT: Most of the events.xml files have been deleted in the refactoring of the payment events. When updating the module manually you
should delete the old module files and copy the new version in freshly to not have the old event triggers in the system to interfere with the new mechanism.
If the module is installed with Composer the update process should handle this correctly by itself.
